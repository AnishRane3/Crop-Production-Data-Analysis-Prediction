# Crop-Production-Data-Analysis-Prediction
Project Overview
This project analyzes and predicts crop production in India using historical data. The dataset spans multiple years and covers various crops, providing insights into production trends and key influencing factors. Advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques are applied to enhance agricultural practices and forecast future trends.

Tools & Technologies
Jupyter Notebook: Used for data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.
Spyder: Employed for model building and performance evaluation.
Data Cleaning
Explored and cleaned the dataset, addressing missing values and standardizing crop names.
Created a "Yield" column and categorized crops into broader groups for easier analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Identified key trends and patterns in crop production.
Highlighted top-performing states and crops, and analyzed production and yield over time.
Machine Learning
Implemented the XGBoost algorithm to predict crop production:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Trained the model with optimal hyperparameters using L1 and L2 regularization.
Evaluated performance with metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
